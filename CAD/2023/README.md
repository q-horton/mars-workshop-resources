# CAD Workshop

CAD software is an integral part of the design process in most engineering disciplines, and will prove to be a very useful tool when completing ENGG1100, METR2800 and further courses. In this workshop, we will provide an introduction to CAD and teach the fundamentals of 3D modelling in Siemens NX. You don't need to have any prior knowledge coming into this workshop, as it is aimed towards students who are completely new to the process. By the end you should be familiar with the user interface of Siemens NX and be able to create simple parts and assemblies.

This workshop was developed in collaboration with [MESS](https://www.facebook.com/messuq/).
