# Linux Terminal / Git Workshop

This workshop runs throught the basics of working in the linux terminal, writing shell scripts, using git version control, and the features that GitHub offers.

This directory contains some relevant scripts.

## Preparation

Make sure that before the workshop you have the sufficient operating system in use. We'll be wanting a linux environment, which can be achieved by:
- Running native Linux
- Running macOS [as a unix-like system should be quite similar]
- Running Windows with either:
    - WSL installed [preferred - [Steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)]
    - Run a linux VM [[Steps](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox)]
